# Infrasound-Monitor
Low cost infrasound monitor using i2c digital differential pressure sensor
Described is a well established opensource geophysics project to monitor atmospheric infrasound 24/7. It employs a modern digital, I2C  enabled diferential pressure sensor  - unlike the older analog devices typically used. The system automatically uploads plots whilst data is stored in standard .mseed for further analysis. Very open-ended with lots of opportunities for students of all levels, schools and above, to redesign and test replacement components. This is  real science, in a little studied area.  The equipment required is relatively cheap to build and offers many opportunities for students of all ages to build and refine a sensing system of research quality. 

The design and software is released open-source.
